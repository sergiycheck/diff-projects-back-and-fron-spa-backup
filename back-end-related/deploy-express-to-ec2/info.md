Guys I tried a lot of services and libraries.
And I found how to choose the right one.

I'm sure you heard about new promising services for deployment like fly.io or heroku and so on.
The are great options to try out, but they are not suitable for production.

Here's the thing:
You may encounter some platform specific issues, but you can't fix them
because not enough people use it and you can't find a solution.

Or you were requested to add some specific features to your app,
but you can't do it because it's not yet supported by the platform.

That's why I suggest to use old fashion way to deploy your app
on the platforms that you control and that is used by many people, like aws or gcp.

It's always a temptation to use new cool services, because of ease of deployment and other great things
but you should be aware of the risks.

And the risk is huge, because you have to redeploy your app to another platform
and spend more money and time.

The same goes for fresh libraries and frameworks.
You may be trapped with some unexpected errors
or missing functionality that is not yet supported.

And you'll have to rewrite a big part of you codebase that's is not fun.

So, I suggest to use either things that you fully control and understand or things that are used by many people and have a big community.
